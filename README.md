# Time of Day Background Color Changer

This program changes the background color of a website to predetermined color themes based on the time of day. The color theme represents different times of the day, such as morning, afternoon, and evening. 

The program uses JavaScript to get the current hour using the `Date` object and the `getHours()` method. Then, it sets the background color of the body element to a linear gradient based on the hour of the day. 

The color schemes used are pastel gradient, simulating the colors of the sky at that time of the day.
The logic behind the program is to use a switch statement, passing the hour as the argument, in this way, the user can define their own colors for each hour range.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the index.html file on a web browser
3. The background color will change based on the current time of day

You can also customize the color scheme by editing the CSS file and defining your own color scheme.

## Note
This program is optimized for color blindness, using complimentary colors that are easy to distinguish.
